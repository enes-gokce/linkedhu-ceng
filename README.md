For the BBM384 Software Engineering Laboratory course, as the Angular Momentum group, we have developed a full-stack web application called LinkedHU_CENG. In this application students, graduates and academics in our department can socialize, share job oppurtunities, share course materials and etc. 

We used Java Spring Boot and MySQL in the backend of the application. 
We used Angular framework, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and jQuery on the frontend of the application.
